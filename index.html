        <div id="img-caption">"Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid activist who served as the first president 
          of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected 
          in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling 
          the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African 
          nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress 
          (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

        <div id="tribute-info">A Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, 
            Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University 
            of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in 
            anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding 
            its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, 
            a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves 
            to its overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence 
            for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People.
